 *  PsychobotWorldMgr - non-combat world behaviours (S22). Self-contained, safe

 *    Rest     - restore health (and mana for mana users) to full when hurt and
 *               out of combat (models eating/drinking; deterministic).
 *    Repair   - self-repair worn gear via Player::DurabilityRepairAll when below
 *               a durability threshold and the bot can afford it.
 *    Mount    - mount up to keep pace with a mounted/distant master (uses a
 *               known mount spell; see notes - needs the bot's mount collection).
 *
 *  Vendor-sell / loot / quest accept+turn-in / gather are FRAMEWORK HOOKS here:

 *  first on-server pass rather than shipped as risky half-implementations.
