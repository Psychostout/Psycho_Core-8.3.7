 *  Dungeon / Raid scripted strategies (S25) - boss-mechanic awareness.
 *  FRAMEWORK + a few key encounters. The statically-safe, generic behaviours
 *  ship now (they work in every dungeon/raid without per-encounter data):
 *    InDungeonOrRaid   - is the bot in an instance?
 *    FightingBoss      - is the bot's current target a dungeon/world boss?
 *    BossCastingInterruptible - the boss is casting an interruptible spell now
 *                        -> the bot should kick it (wired as a trigger).
 *
 *  Per-encounter scripts (move out of THIS ground effect, spread/stack, soak,
 *  switch to THIS add) need encounter-specific positions/spell ids that can't be
 *  resolved statically. They are an EncounterScript registry (RegisterEncounter
 *  by creature entry) with a couple of seeded example entries; the concrete
 *  reactions are documented hooks for the first on-server pass.
