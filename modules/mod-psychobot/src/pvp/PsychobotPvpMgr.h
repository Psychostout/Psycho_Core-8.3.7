 *  PvP / Battleground coordination (S24). Detects the BG/arena context and
 *  classifies its objective flavor, and supplies a PvP target (nearest enemy
 *  player) so bots actually FIGHT in instanced PvP and open-world PvP.
 *
 *    BgFlavor       - how the BG is won (the per-BG tactics branch on this).
 *    GetBgFlavor    - classify the bot's current BG from its TypeId.
 *    InActiveBattleground - true while a joined BG is actually running.
 *    GetPvpTarget   - nearest valid enemy player within range (the assist /
 *                     combat target seed when in PvP).
 *
 *  Per-BG objective tactics (carry the flag, capture the base, take the boss,
 *  man the vehicle) are FRAMEWORK HOOKS: they need live BG objective objects +
 *  positions that vary per battleground and can't be resolved statically, so
 *  they're gated/documented for the first on-server pass. The always-safe PvP
 *  behaviour (find + kill the nearest enemy, stay with the group) ships now.
